High Quality Code

Problem 1.	Custom Linked List
Use the VS solution "CustomLinkedList".
•	Create new Unit Test Project and add reference to the “CustomLinkedList”.
•	Create Test Methods for all public members that need testing.
•	Create tests that ensure all methods, getters and setters work correctly (do not test auto-properties).  
•	Use the [ExpectedException(typeof(Exception)] attribute for methods that are expected to throw exception in case wrong input is entered(those tests doesn’t need assert messages).
•	Give meaningful assert messages for failed tests.
